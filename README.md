I’m a student of Information Technology (Cybersecurity & Forensics Hons) .

I use GitHub as a personal knowledge archive 
Most of what you’ll find here is not “finished work”, but **thinking in progress**.

## How I Use This Space

This profile is not a showcase of hype or shortcuts.

It exists to:
- Capture structured notes 
- Translate theory into clarity
- Log experiments, observations, and tool usage responsibly

If something is here, it means I took the time to understand *why it works*, not just *how*.

## Areas I’m Actively Exploring

- Computer Networking (from fundamentals upward)
- Linux and system-level concepts
- Core cybersecurity principles
- Introductory OSINT and security tooling
- Programming fundamentals with a focus on logic, not syntax

## My Learning Philosophy

I don’t believe in rushing into advanced labels.
I believe in strong roots, clean notes, and honest progress.

"Book learning alone is not enough to cultivate intelligence"

## Beyond Academics

I enjoy understanding how real-world systems are designed — technical or otherwise.  
I value clarity, curiosity, and quiet consistency more than noise or trends.
